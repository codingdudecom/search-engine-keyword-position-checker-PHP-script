# Search Engine Keyword Position Checker PHP Script

## Google SERP Checker PHP Script

I've made this SERP checker PHP script that shows the position or Google rank of a page for a certain keyword search. 

It also displays a preview of the how a certain page looks search engine results page. Though SERP is a generic term referring to all search engine results, I will only focus on Google.  

This is a keyword ranking checker PHP script that allows checking the Google ranking of a page for a particular keyword online, but this presents several challenges because Google restricts scrapping info from their pages. There is a work around by using the Google API.  You can download the source code for this PHP script for free. 

The SERP Checker PHP script is free to use for personal and commercial use with attribution.
